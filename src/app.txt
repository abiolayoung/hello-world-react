* component can refer to other component in their output.
* dont be afraid to split component into smaller component
* elements that need keys should be unique non-random identifiers
* method should be in camel case and be named for their function.

for a react components to work accordingly, the function has to be declared in pascal casing
the curly braces is used when importing an object or array in any region of our project, other than tagging it with </>

events in react
Events in React are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
Example events are onClick, onChange, onSubmit.

Change event- for example input fields (onChange)
submit event - to submit a form (onSubmit)
mouse event - for examle mouse over and mouse out (onMouseOver)
